# Module 9/ Surf's up with advanced data storage and retrieval. 


## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
In this module we created an analysis that contains statistical information about temperature trends before opening the future surf shop/ ice cream shop. We extracted temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We created a query for the months of June and December and were able to retrieve statistical information such as average/ maximum /and minimum temperatures.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- One major point is that June has 1700 counts of observations and December has 1517 counts of observations, there is some missing data in December but it is still large enough to produce a representative analysis. 
- Another major point is that the years that were oberserved were from 2010 to 2017.
- A third major point is the low standard deivation in June suggests that the spread in terms of temperatures is a small spread, the weather in June  displays consistentcy in terms of temperatures. The data chart for December displays very similar statistics to June, and the standard deviation (the spread) is almost very similar to the June chart stats. 

Below are screen captures of the charts for June Temperatures and December Temperatures.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

We can infer that the temperature patterns remain steady throughout the whole year, based on the data collected. The two queries that need to be collected and analyzed is precipitation data points for June and December--we then would be able to gather some insight whether or not precipitation rates would impact the surf shop/ ice cream shop's business sustainability. Precipitation data analysis could give us an overall view of weather pattern. The last query we can analyze are active weather stations---which can help us narrow down the most popular stations and where the most stable weather patterns are located.
